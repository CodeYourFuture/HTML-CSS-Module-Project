# karma-clone

The aim of this exercise is to create a page that looks just like this one: 


![alt text](./Karma%20-%20desktop%20design.png "Karma desktop design")


### Tasks

 - **Fork and clone** this repo.
   - To fork, hit the 'fork' button in the top right corner of this page on Github. 
  Now you should be on your own Github repository - you'll know this because your name should now be in the repo name at the top of the Github page. 
   - To clone, click the green button that says 'Code' on that page.
  Now the code is on your own machine (this happened when you cloned), AND it's linked to your own Karma repository on Github (which was created when you forked).
 - Before you start coding, **create a new branch** with your name in the format: `london-class-7/karma/adam-smith`
  Your branch name should be all lowercase, with no spaces. 
 - **Edit `index.html` and `style.css`** to create a perfect copy of the design above!
 - **Commit and push your code often** so you get into the habit and you avoid losing any code that you write if your machine crashes for example. 
 - Once you're ready to submit your homework for review, do a final push and **create a Pull Request**. If you're unsure how to do this, [have a look here](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/git/cheatsheet/#i-want-to-send-my-code-to-volunteers-pushing).
