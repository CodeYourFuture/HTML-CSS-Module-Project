# Notes

- What did you find easy?
writing basic structure with html 
- What did you find hard?
Its not hard ,just need enough practice to build those muscle memory , as I still forgot something I already knew 

- What do you still not understand?

There was this unwanted gap like a margin between header and hero section , I thought it must be some automatic reserved margin or padding for some elements ,tried like ten different ways and none solved the issue , so i set a border for header and hero to see exactly what causes this , and strangely it disappears as soon as I defined a border for hero !! so I still don't now the reason and the best way to solve it.

- Any other notes?
It would be more precise if we could have a Figma file ,to make a code for instead of png picture,so we don't need to guess  colors and font size and paddings... and the assignment can be done precisely.
