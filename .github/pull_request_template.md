# Notes

- What did you find easy? I found the HTML quite straight forward

- What did you find hard? Some CSS elements, I thought would work however the didn't effect the overall look

- What do you still not understand? not sure if it's the css or the html but some parts still aren't matching

- Any other notes?
I have reallt tried hard to match the webpage however there are still parts I want to change however can't work out how to.
