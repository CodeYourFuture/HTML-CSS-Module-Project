# Notes

- What did you find easy?
I found it easy to create the HTML structure and I was also feeling confident with 60% of the CSS.

- What did you find hard?
1. I found it hard to do the debugging and sometimes it took me a long time to find out what was going on. 
2. Even if I feel like I am making progress using the inspection tool, I still don't feel very confident using it. 

- What do you still not understand?
I am a bit confused with the way we should use the absolute and relative units: rem, em and px.  I find it quite hard to estimate the value in rems. I would like to hear any suggestions that will make this process easier. 

- Any other notes?
I really enjoyed working on this project as this was the first clone I have ever made. I realize it is a good way to practice and it really helped me to see what parts of the CSS and HTML I still need to learn more in depth.
