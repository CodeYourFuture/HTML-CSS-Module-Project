# Notes

- What did you find easy? using css properties. I think its straight forward most times (not all the time) you can easily find answers to solutions.

- What did you find hard? making the form was really challenging, took a lot of research and study to eventually get the specific design

- What do you still not understand? I get a bit confused when it comes to page layout of images and content

- Any other notes?
