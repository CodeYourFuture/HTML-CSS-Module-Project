# Notes

- What did you find easy?
I had no difficulty making the HTML structure (header, div, section,...)

- What did you find hard?
I don't quite understand how to make the structure in CSS and I have difficulty using containers, how to use elements inside containers

- What do you still not understand?
It's hard for me to use elements inside containers and modify these elements, and sometimes I don't understand how I can do the structure in HTML and connect in CSS

- Any other notes?
I would like more exercises like this to practice, it was difficult for me to do this exercise, I spent a lot of time doing this
