# Notes

- What did you find easy?
HTML has become second nature in a way, It's easy to read and write especialy since the introduction of semantic tags.
- What did you find hard?
Nothing is easy but then again nothing is hard either.  I believe It's just a matter of practice. 
- What do you still not understand?
At this stage I cant think of anything that we covered that I feel uncomfortable with. So far so good.
- Any other notes?
Some assignments are not very clear.  I wonder if this is done on purpose?
